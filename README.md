# üí± Exchange API

A clean, modular **Currency Exchange API** built with **.NET 9**, **C# 12**, and **Clean Architecture** principles.  
The API retrieves and caches exchange rates from the **NBP (National Bank of Poland)** and supports currency conversion with configurable commission strategies.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Fetch real-time and historical currency exchange rates from **NBP API**
- Convert between currencies using current or historical rates
- Automatic fallback: if a rate is not in the local database, it is fetched from the external NBP API
- Commission calculation using the **Strategy** pattern
- Extensible design with **Factory** and **Decorator** patterns
- In-memory caching to minimize API calls and database access
- Built with **SOLID principles**, full DI, and **MediatR (CQRS)**

## üß© Architecture Overview

### **External Integration**
The app uses the **NBP public API** (`https://api.nbp.pl/api/exchangerates/`) to fetch currency exchange rates.  
A dedicated `IRateProvider` abstraction defines how external providers should supply rates, and `NbpRateProvider` implements it.

### **Persistence**
Fetched rates are stored in a local **MySQL** database via the `IRateRepository` abstraction.

### **Caching**
To reduce latency and limit external API calls, an `ICacheService` (implemented via `MemoryCacheService`) stores rates in-memory for 15‚Äì30 minutes.

A `RateLookupService` handles the logic of retrieving a rate from:
1. Cache
2. Database
3. NBP API (if missing locally)

### **Exchange Calculation**
`CurrencyExchangeService` coordinates the exchange logic:
1. Retrieves source and target currency rates via `IRateLookupService`
2. Converts amounts using the `Money` value object
3. Applies commission via the **Strategy Pattern**

## üß† Design Patterns Used

| Pattern | Location | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Strategy** | `IExchangeStrategy` + implementations | Defines how commissions are calculated for different transaction sizes |
| **Factory** | `IExchangeStrategyFactory` | Dynamically selects the proper strategy based on transaction amount |
| **Decorator (planned)** | `CachedRateLookupService` | Adds caching behavior around rate retrieval without modifying core logic |
| **Value Object** | `Money` | Represents an immutable amount and currency, encapsulating arithmetic safely |
| **Repository** | `IRateRepository` | Abstracts persistence logic for currency rates |
| **CQRS** | `ExchangeQuery`, `GetRateQuery` | Separates read logic from write operations via MediatR |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **.NET 9**
- **C# 12**
- **MediatR**
- **FluentValidation**
- **Entity Framework Core**
- **MySQL 8**
- **MemoryCache**
- **Swagger / OpenAPI**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The connection string for MySQL is defined in `appsettings.json`:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "Default": "server=localhost;port=3306;database=exchange;user=root;password=your_password;AllowUserVariables=True"
}
```

---

## üß™ Testing

- **Unit tests** are written with `xUnit` and `FluentAssertions`
- Services and strategies are designed to be **easily mockable**
- **Integration tests** verify full end-to-end flows (DB + NBP API)

---

## üß∞ Example Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/currencies` | List supported currencies |
| `GET` | `/rates?currency=USD&date=2025-01-01` | Get exchange rate for a currency and date |
| `GET` | `/rates/exchange?from=USD&to=PLN&amount=100` | Convert currency with applied commission |
| `POST` | `/rates/fetch` | Fetch and persist historical rates |

---

## üß© Extensibility

The architecture allows easy extension:
- Add new exchange rate providers (e.g., ECB, Fixer.io)
- Add new commission strategies
- Replace caching mechanism (Redis, distributed memory)
- Decorate or override `IRateLookupService` for cross-cutting concerns (logging, caching, etc.)
